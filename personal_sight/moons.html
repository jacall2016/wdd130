                <h2>no-moon</h2>
                <p>life on earth without a moon would be very different The has a great effect upon the tides of our planet. Without the moon the tides would be much weaker and only effected by the sun. In adition the moon helps keep earths axial tilt stable. The earths axial tilt has a profound effect on the seasons. A greater axial tilt makes seasons more extream, lesser they are more stable. A axial tilt that is stable keeps reagions of the earth under more stable contitions for long piriods of time.</p>

                <h2>small-moon</h2>
                <p>A small moon would have weaker effects on the tide unless that moon was much closer to the planet, and large enouph to compensate for the difference. distance matters in tidal forces. The farther a moon is from it's planet the less tidal forces that moon feels. This is why earth is not tidally locked to our sun. The earth is too far away for the tidal forces to force earth into a tidally locked situation.</p>

                <h2>rings</h2>
                <p>A planet with rings would have several unquie challanges. First if the rings are too close to the planet then the planet will have a lot of inpacts as rocks in the rings decay into the planets atmosphere. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if the rocks were small and sparce, but if their are a lot then a high level of heat would be generated from the decaying rocks or if they are too large then too many impacts on the surface will render the planet virtually uninhabitable. If however the rings are farther away then this isn't a problem. Navigation spaceships and satilies would be more challanging in a ring system and depending upon the density of the ring system it may be infeasible. also the rings may difuse the light reaching the planet to verring extents depending upon the composition of the rings, casting shadows accross vast reagions of the planet determined by the orientation of the rings in cordination with the orientation of the solar system plane.</p>

                <h2>double planet system</h2>
                <p>double planet systems enable strange interations. Day length would likely increase, if both planets are large enouph life could exist on both allowing much easier transfer of life from one to the other. depending upon the distances tidal forces may be much stronger.</p>

                <p>if a gas giant had earth sized habitable moons and was located in the habitable zone of its star then these would offer strange habitats for life.</p>
